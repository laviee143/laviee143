Welcome to Kawaii TodoList — a cute and cheerful to-do list app I put together to help keep track of everyday tasks with a little extra charm. I was inspired by kawaii aesthetics, so I went with a soft pink background, a sweet bunny image, and a simple layout that’s easy to use. You can add new tasks, check them off when you're done, or remove them with a click. I really wanted this to feel both useful and visually fun, so I played around with gentle colors and playful styling to make it feel more enjoyable to use.
The whole thing runs with just HTML and CSS, so you can open it right in your browser without needing to install anything. I also added a cheerful "Tasks added successfully!" message as a bit of encouragement. Building it had its ups and downs—designing the layout was fun, but getting everything to line up and work the way I wanted took some trial and error. Still, I’m proud of how it turned out! Whether you’re organizing your day or just jotting down reminders, I hope this little app brings a smile while keeping you on track.

Creating this little app was both fun and a bit challenging at times. The layout and design part came together pretty smoothly—I started by setting up the basic HTML and CSS, then added some soft pastel colors and a cute bunny image to bring out that kawaii vibe I was going for. Using Flexbox helped me neatly arrange the tasks, and adding some hover effects made it feel a bit more interactive.

The tricky part was getting the buttons to work just right and making sure the task list updated properly without breaking the layout. I ran into a few hiccups with CSS selectors and spacing, so I had to go back and fine-tune those details. To keep things manageable, I took it step by step: I focused on the static layout first, then added the interactive parts and tested along the way. In the end, it was a fun learning experience, and I’m really happy with how it turned out—it’s simple, cute, and actually useful!
